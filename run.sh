# pseudo-cron (which self-requests the public site URL) can never reach it —
# this loop calls it from inside the container instead, on the loopback
# interface nginx already trusts. Opt-in via WP_CRON_TRIGGER_ENABLED (off by
# default — this is a shared base image, and existing capsules relying on
# their own external cron trigger shouldn't get a second one silently added
# on their next image update). Tune the interval with
# WP_CRON_TRIGGER_INTERVAL_SECONDS.

# doing anything yet" are indistinguishable from the logs alone.

# instead spin it tight enough to exhaust FPM workers), which is exactly the
# kind of silent cron failure this loop exists to fix in the first place.
